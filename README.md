#Bootstrap MegaMenu

Bootstrap MegaMenu allows you to create a mega menu with an innovative back-end user interface and synchronized with Drupal core menu.

Full credit to themebrain for developing the tb_megamenu module. However since it appears they are uninterested in supporting Bootstrap 3 we have decided it would be a useful addition to the community if we created a port.

This is port designed to play nice with the Bootstrap base theme and Bootstrap 3 based themes.
